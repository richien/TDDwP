# He is invited to enter a to-do item straight away

# He types "buy peacock feathers" into a text box (His hobby
# is tying fly fishing lures)

# When he hits enter, the page updates, and now the page lists
# "1: Buy peacock feathers" as an item in a to-do list

# There is still a text box inviting him to add another item. He 
# enters "Use peacock feathers to make a fly" (He is very methodical)

# The page updates again, and now shows both items on his list

# He wonders whether the site will remember his list. Then he sees
# that the site has generated a unique URL for him -- there is some
# explanatory text to that effect.

# He visits the URL - his to-do list is still there.

# Satisfied, he goes back to sleep
